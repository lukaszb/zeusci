Zeus-CI
=======

Flexible, yet modern Continous Integration server you'd love to use.

**WARNING** This is pre-alpha software. Master branch is just a proof of
concept - it's messy and smelly. This branch is on the other hand totally
*broken*. We are now focusing on defining the project from user and developer
perspectives. For that we are building documentation that would include minimal
set before first stable release. It's in a ``docs/`` directory.

Setup a Zeus-CI project
=======================

Once ``zeus-ci`` is installed command line tool ``zci`` is available.

Initialization
--------------

In order to initialize a project we need to run::

    $ zci init [PROJECT_PATH]

By invoking this command we create a ``zeus-ci`` project. It would create a
following structure of files and directories::

    PROJECT_ROOT/
        app/
            zeusapp/
                __init__.py
                settings.py
                urls.py
                wsgi.py
            manage.py
        var/
            builds/
            logs/
        venv/
            ... (content of Python sandbox)


Let's describe briefly what those are:

- ``app/`` directory contains skeleton for ``zeus-ci``, Django_-based project.
  Read more on :ref:`how to integrate with existing Django project
  <integration>`.

- ``venv/`` directory contains sandboxed Python_ environment. Our project would
  use only Python packages and linked binary from this environment. Read more
  on virtualenv_.

- ``var/`` here all *various* files would be stored. By default, ``zeus-ci``
  would store here all logs and builds-related files.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to :ref:`configure <configuration>` our project first. By default, our
project would use sqlite_ database and RabbitMQ_ server as message broker
(needed for communication between web server and build workers).

.. note::
   Make sure to :ref:`configure <configuration>` project for your needs before
   using it in production.


After configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For running commands we will use ``manage.py`` script. For example run::

    $ app/manage.py

to list all available commands.

Prepare database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ app/manage.py syncdb

This will prepare our database. It will also ask to create administrator user
which we should do now.


Running web server
------------------

Development server is invoked by running::

    $ app/manage.py runserver


Running worker
--------------

In another terminal run::

    $ app/manage.py celery worker


Add project
===========

We need to go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and log in with credentials provided at
the database preparation step. As admin user we can follow instructions on main
page in order to create a project.
